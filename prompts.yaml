generate_flashcards: |
  You are an expert educational content creator. Based on the following context, generate a list of {{card_amount}} flashcards in Python dictionary format, each with:

  - a 'front' field (the question),
  - a 'back' field (the answer),
  - a 'tags' field containing the topic: "{{topic}}"

  If the text below is not "None" use the text as basis for the cards, else use the topic as basis for the card information:

  {{text}}

  Verify: Use your internal tools—code interpreter, web search (if available), and data analysis—to fact-check key details and ensure accuracy.
  
  Output format:
  [
      {"front": "Question 1?", "back": "Answer 1", "tags": "{{topic}}"},
      ...
  ]

  Only return the Python list of dictionaries.
  Do not include your thought process—just provide the best, most accurate answer possible.
